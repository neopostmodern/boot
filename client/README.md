# BOOT: Client (SBC)

This subpackage is a hardcoded mess for a specific project at the moment. It takes care of loading rendered media and
performing the pay across the connected physical periphery (including servos, LEDs, a microphone, and multi-channel
audio output).

Complete refactoring coming up to a plugin infrastructure.
